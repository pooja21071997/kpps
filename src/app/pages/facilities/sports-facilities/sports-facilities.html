            Sports play a vital role in the holistic development of students. Our school promotes
            physical education as an essential part of academic life, ensuring students remain
            physically active, mentally sharp, and emotionally balanced.

            The campus features a spacious football ground, two volleyball courts, two kho-kho
            grounds, a cricket ground, and a multipurpose basketball court. These facilities
            encourage teamwork, discipline, leadership, and strategic thinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond physical fitness, sports teach resilience, sportsmanship, and the ability to
            handle both success and setbacks gracefully. Our sports infrastructure supports the
            development of confident and well-rounded individuals.
